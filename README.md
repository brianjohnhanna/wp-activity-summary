# WP Activity Summary

This WordPress plugin registers a helpful dashboard widget that helps administrators 
and other site users keep track of what is being posted and when.

It currently includes two distinct views:
- See the latest posts presented in descending order
- See the latest authors sorted by who posted most recently, along with total post count

An email can also go out to site administrators on a schedule to print out various views in their inbox.

---

Future Planned Changes
- Add additional views and filtering
- Configure schedule for site 
- Add ability to present results on the front end
- Include support for PressPermit Permission Groups (to display results by group instead of user)
